# 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?

I took approximately 11 hours.

# 2. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I would totally improve the UI&UX for a more fluid experience, like adding the logo of the restaurant. I would also add a filter to be able to choose ratings or type of cuisines by using the filter() function thatâ€™s already provided by JavaScript language.

# 3. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?

Although this function does not belong to the latest JavaScript update, it was one of the updates that most revolutionized the way of asynchronous programming and, in this project, to use the API in a more efficient way was fundamental. It started with callback functions that allowed you to define asynchronous behavior through functions passed to other functions as parameters, this was upgraded by introducing Promises. Then, finally, with ES8 (2017), it was introduced the async/await syntax. It made the process of writing asynchronous code easier, simpler, and more intuitive. Using Asynchronous programming allows us to get much more things done in a short amount of time which can be very helpful in web applications.

# 4 How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

I've never had to do that specifically, but if I had to, I'd probably implement a performance monitor that displays how long it takes to render a page so I can know on what requests I should focus on, or even present the greatest execution time and liek this we can see what are the good targets for optimization, then, using a test platform I could narrow down the cause of the performance problems.
